# Hi there, I'm Aaron 👋

Data Engineer passionate about building scalable data systems, exploring new technologies, and writing about data and machine learning topics.

## 🚀 About Me

I design and optimize reliable data systems while exploring the intersection of data systems and machine learning operations. Previously, I helped Meta’s research teams collect and process millions of annotations for computer vision projects presented at [CVPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01795).

- 🔭 Currently working on serverless data architectures at scale
- 🌱 Exploring open source data tools and building educational content
- 📝 I write about ML and engineering at [enerrio.bearblog.dev](https://enerrio.bearblog.dev)
- 📍 Based in the Bay Area, CA
